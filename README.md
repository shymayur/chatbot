# chatbot
Its the end to end chatbot project.
A chatbot is a computer program that understands the intent of your query to answer with a solution. Chatbots are the most popular applications of Natural Language Processing in the industry.

# What is an End to End Chatbot?
An end-to-end chatbot refers to a chatbot that can handle a complete conversation from start to finish without requiring human assistance. To create an end-to-end chatbot, you need to write a computer program that can understand user requests, generate appropriate responses, and take action when necessary. This involves collecting data, choosing a programming language and NLP tools, training the chatbot, and testing and refining it before making it available to users. 

Once deployed, users can interact with the chatbot by sending it multiple requests and the chatbot can handle the entire conversation itself. To create an end-to-end chatbot using Python, we can follow the steps mentioned below:

# steps:
1. Define Intents
2. Create training data
3. Train the chatbot
4. Build the chatbot
5. Test the chatbot
6. Deploy the chatbot

To turn this chatbot into an end-to-end chatbot, we need to deploy it to interact with the chatbot using a user interface.
To deploy the chatbot, I have used the streamlit library in Python, which provides amazing features to create a user interface for a Machine Learning application in just a few lines of code.


To run this chatbot, use the command mentioned below in your terminal:
streamlit run filename.py

# Thanks Note:
I hope you now have understood what an end-to-end chatbot is and the process of creating an end-to-end chatbot.
